Exploratory Data Analysis


State the goal:
  What is the question you are seeking to answer?
  Define metrics of success: accuracy score, precision, etc.


Explore Data:
  Look at the columns and missing values by column
    df.isnull().sum()
  Check data types
  View the values for all discrete columns by doing a value count
 	  have any labels been miscoded?


Take Action:
  Handle Missing Values
    drop missing values or impute values
  Change Data Types if applicable
  Can new features be engineered out of the given data?
  Put all column names into appropriate list
    Discrete Not Dummied, Discrete Dummied, Continuous, Date
  Does a continuous column need to be binned?
	  pd.cut()
  Convert discrete values to dummies and concat to original dataframe
    for col in discrete:
      df = pd.concat([df, pd.get_dummies(df[col], prefix=col, prefix_sep="_")], axis='columns')


Check for data correctness:
	Are all units in each column within the correct range?
  	ie, past data canâ€™t have dates from the future
		look at min and max value of each column to see if the extremes max sense
    
    
Check correlation between continuous columns (dont include target)
	  for collinearlity, if pairwise correlation is greater than 0.9, drop one column
  	for multicollinearity, if VIF is greater than 10, drop that column
  

Make histograms, box plots, density plots, scatter plots
	consider plotting on a log scale 


Normalize / Standardize data
Check for outliers
  if standardizing, shrink any values with a standard deviation above 3 or below -3
  cap the values between -4 and 4


Feature Selection
  Select K Best
  create multiple list of features by taking 50%, 75%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 100%


Split your data into training and testing sets


Run models with different algorithms and different subsets of features per your feature selection lists previously created
